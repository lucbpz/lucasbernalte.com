Astro Nano is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme.

Built with Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, an no frameworks.

It was designed as an even more minimal theme than my popular theme [Astro Sphere](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere)

## 🕊️ Lightweight

No frameworks or added bulk

## ⚡︎ Fast

Rendered in ~40ms on localhost
